Here is the first block of this blog by a bloke who is interested in building blocks of a blockchain and the technology therein. I am a student at IITR majoring in mathematics. Here I will try to write about the things that I learn, books that I read, lessons that I learn yada yada.  I am starting this blog as a personal diary to document my metamorphosis from a school kid to a better student, programmer, hacker and of course a cat memer.

My language of intrest is C++ and python but here I will try to convey my ideas in English, French and sometimes Russian (Of course I speak all these languages).
